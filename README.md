# RandomColorScheme
RandomColorScheme plugin for Sublime Text 2/3

This plugin offers a great way to handle changing Sublime Text's color-scheme to a random one very quickly.

### Settings:
`"do_not_include_packages": []`

This setting can be used to avoid setting random color-scheme from specific packages.

`"do_not_include_filenames": []`

This setting avoids setting the color-scheme of specified filenames.

### Thanks:
This plugin is highly inspired from an already present plugin by [jugyo](https://github.com/jugyo/SublimeColorSchemeSelector).
